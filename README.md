This project aims to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The dataset used consists of historical agricultural data, ensuring accuracy in predictions.
Key features include:

Machine Learning Models: Multiple algorithms were implemented and evaluated for accuracy, with Random Forest emerging as the best-performing model.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): An interactive Tkinter-based interface allows users to input soil and environmental conditions and get crop recommendations in real time.
Model Storage: Trained models are saved using the Pickle library for quick deployment and reuse.
Performance Comparison: Visualization of accuracy across different algorithms is provided to showcase model performance.
